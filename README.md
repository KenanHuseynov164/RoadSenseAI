# RoadSenseAI
RoadSenseAI is an advanced intelligent software system created to provide users with clear, accessible, and contextually correct interpretations of Azerbaijani traffic laws. The system allows drivers to describe an incident in natural language and then automatically analyzes the situation, identifies the most relevant legal articles, retrieves fine information, and generates a concise Azerbaijani explanation that is understandable to non-experts. This includes a short legal summary, a practical recommendation tailored to the scenario, and even a suggested statement the driver could use when speaking with a police officer. The primary motivation behind RoadSenseAI is the difficulty most drivers face when trying to understand the legal terminology, structure, and complexity of traffic rules and penalties. By integrating structured law data, optional live website retrieval, and a carefully controlled AI interpretation engine, the system makes legal information accessible, transparent, and personalized.

The overall system architecture adopts a full-stack design consisting of several cooperating layers: a React-based frontend for user interaction, a FastAPI backend that coordinates business logic, a relational SQLite database for persistent storage, a structured JSON law repository that contains official legal articles and corresponding penalties, optional web scrapers that dynamically collect law information from authoritative Azerbaijani sources, and an AI engine powered by a large-language model. These layers communicate with one another through well-defined interfaces. The frontend is responsible solely for capturing user input and presenting output, while all complex processing occurs in the backend. This separation of concerns not only improves maintainability, but also ensures that system components can evolve independently without introducing uncontrolled dependencies.

At the heart of the backend lies the application layer implemented with FastAPI. This layer performs essential tasks such as routing requests, validating user input, enforcing authentication, invoking the system’s internal analysis modules, managing database sessions, and assembling the final JSON responses returned to the frontend. It contains no substantive legal or AI logic by design; instead, it delegates all interpretation and data-processing responsibilities to specialized components. This allows the application layer to remain clean, testable, and independent of future enhancements to the AI or law-searching mechanisms.

Another major component is the authentication module, which governs user identity management. It creates new user accounts, securely hashes passwords, verifies credentials during login, issues JWT tokens, and extracts user information from tokens to authorize protected operations. By isolating all security-related logic into this dedicated module, the system ensures high cohesion and minimizes the chances of accidental vulnerabilities. Other subsystems rely only on its public methods, leading to low coupling and strong modularity, which is important for any system handling sensitive user data.

Incident management constitutes the core domain functionality of RoadSenseAI. Every time a user submits an incident description, this module creates a structured record that includes the original text, the matched legal articles, the AI-generated explanation, and other metadata such as timestamps. These incident entries form the user’s personal history, allowing them to revisit past interpretations. The incident manager interacts closely with both the database layer and the AI engine, but its purpose is strictly confined to storing, retrieving, formatting, and presenting incidents. This narrow responsibility ensures that incident-related logic remains independent from authentication, scraping, and AI processing, thereby promoting maintainability.

Legal knowledge is maintained in a separate component consisting of a structured laws.json repository and a search engine capable of retrieving relevant legal articles. The JSON file provides an authoritative local knowledge base containing article numbers, titles, fines, summaries, and full legal text. The search engine examines incoming queries and identifies the laws whose text best matches the user’s description, using word similarity and keyword heuristics. This design allows the legal data layer to remain fully decoupled: it does not depend on any part of the system, yet other components rely heavily on it. By isolating all law-related operations in one cohesive unit, the system ensures that updates to Azerbaijani traffic laws can be made easily by modifying only the JSON dataset.

To ensure that the system remains up-to-date when necessary, RoadSenseAI includes optional scraping modules that retrieve live legal information from authoritative online platforms such as Avtostop.az and DYP.gov.az. When a user submits an incident, the system attempts to match applicable law articles through online scraping before falling back to the local JSON database. Although these scrapers do not maintain persistent internal state, they provide an important bridge between static legal data and dynamic real-world law updates. They are implemented as independent modules to preserve modularity: the backend can function entirely without them, and their absence does not break the system, which maintains robustness and predictable behavior.

The AI interpretation engine is the most sophisticated component of the system. Once relevant legal articles have been identified, they, together with the user’s description, are sent to an OpenAI large-language model. This model, guided by a tightly controlled system prompt, produces a structured JSON response containing legal articles, an explanation written in accessible Azerbaijani, practical advice, and a suggested statement for interacting with law enforcement. The engine imposes strict constraints on the AI model, forcing it to rely exclusively on the matched laws and preventing the generation of fabricated legal content. The result is an AI-driven explanation mechanism that benefits from natural-language fluency while remaining grounded in verifiable law data.

Finally, persistent storage is implemented using SQLite through SQLAlchemy ORM. Two tables—users and incidents—capture all long-term application data. The schema is intentionally simple: one user can own many incidents, forming a clean one-to-many relationship. This minimalistic design enhances performance, reduces development overhead, and supports straightforward data retrieval during history queries. SQLAlchemy mediates all interactions with the database, offering both type safety and flexibility.

Taken together, these components demonstrate a well-structured and thoughtfully modularized architecture that adheres to the principles of high cohesion and low coupling. Each subsystem has a clearly defined purpose, interacts only through defined interfaces, and can evolve independently. RoadSenseAI not only showcases modern full-stack design practices but also highlights a responsible integration of AI into a legally sensitive domain. Through its layered architecture, strict separation of responsibilities, and controlled AI reasoning mechanisms, it achieves both technical robustness and practical utility.
